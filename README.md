# BraTum Scans -- Brain Tumor Classification using MobileNet-v2
## SCOPE--INTRODUCTION
Brain Tumor is one of the deadly diseases prevailing in today's world. It's timely detection is very important to start the treatment process immediately.Brain tumor classification using machine learning is a significant and rapidly evolving field with broad implications for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. As medical imaging technologies continue to advance, the amount of data generated from brain scans has grown exponentially, creating both opportunities and challenges. Machine learning techniques offer a powerful means to process and interpret this data, assisting medical professionals in accurately identifying and classifying different types of brain tumors. The scope of brain tumor classification encompasses various modalities, including MRI, CT scans, and PET scans, each providing unique insights into the tumor's characteristics. By training models on large datasets containing labeled tumor images, machine learning algorithms can learn intricate patterns and features indicative of different tumor types, grades, and locations. The ultimate goal is to provide clinicians with efficient and reliable tools to aid in early detection, precise diagnosis, and personalized treatment recommendations. With the potential to expedite diagnoses, minimize subjectivity, and improve patient outcomes, brain tumor classification using machine learning holds immense promise in the realm of medical image analysis and healthcare innovation.
